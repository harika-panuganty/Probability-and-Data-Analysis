# Probability-and-Data-Analysis

The first project for my Intermediate Applied Data Analysis class from the MscBMI Program at The University of Chicago focused on Probability and Basic Data Analysis in R. The code for this repository elaborates on the specific code used to answer questions from the aforementioned topics. 

The first section: Probability, tested beginner and high-levels concepts such as probability of picking a certain card from a deck and filling in probability tables. 

The second section: Data Analysis using R is further sub-divided into two categories, a) building a 2X2 table studying the association between two variables within the dataset and b) de-identifying patient data.
